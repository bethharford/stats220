## My meme

My meme includes two contrasting pictures of Kim Kardashian. They are contrasting because in one image she is happy and in the other one she is miserable. In general, I think the kardasian family is very dramatic so I thought it was fitting to include Kim Kardasian with the specific text I used alongside.

My meme is different because I have taken two arbitrary photos of Kim Kardashain on the internet and spliced them with text that compliments her expression in each photo.

## My animated GIF

My animated gif includes several frames which symbolize a countdown to the new year. My animated gif is original because I used counts to signal the 3,2,1 countdown and included the char_vector to include happy new year" as the last frame in the sequence.
